<p align="center">
    <h3>Welcome, Captain, to your new cruiser!</h3>
    <p>Thank you for allowing the VanRyder brand to be a part of your family. The state-of-the-art T0M4-b12 cruiser, or TOMA, for short, is a legally certified deep space long-haul craft capable of hauling a max payload of 325,000 lbs of cargo! Wowee! Just make sure to maintain your ship if you ever want to make it back from deep space.</p>
    <p>Tomagatchi Time is a space-themed tamagatchi spinoff where you 'care' for your ship as it ages. It's a simple web-browser game where you manage 3 resources, just like the classic!</p>
